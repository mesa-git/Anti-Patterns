NOTE: Done because some "mod" on wikipedia decided "first of all, "lists of examples" are not always encyclopedic; they are more a trash can."
The original page was here: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-pattern
So here's the trash can:

<br><br>

##Project management
<br>

    Cart before the horse: Focusing too many resources on a stage of a project out of its sequence
    Death march: A project whose staff, while expecting it to fail, are compelled to continue, often with much overwork, by management in denial of the project's possible failure[7]
    Ninety-ninety rule: Tendency to underestimate the amount of time to complete a project when it is "nearly done"
    Overengineering: Spending resources making a project more robust and complex than is needed
    Scope creep: Uncontrolled changes or continuous growth in a project's scope, or adding new features to the project after the original requirements have been drafted and accepted (also known as requirement creep and feature creep)
    Smoke and mirrors: Demonstrating unimplemented functions as if they were already implemented
    Brooks's law: Adding more resources to a project to increase velocity, when the project is already slowed by coordination overhead
    Gold plating: Continuing to work on a task or project well past the point at which extra effort is not adding value

Software engineering
Software design

    Abstraction inversion: Not exposing implemented functionality required by callers of a function/method/constructor, so that the calling code awkwardly re-implements the same functionality in terms of those calls
    Ambiguous viewpoint: Presenting a model (usually Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)) without specifying its viewpoint
    Big ball of mud: A system with no recognizable structure
    Database-as-IPC: Using a database as the message queue for routine interprocess communication where a much more lightweight mechanism would be suitable
    Inner-platform effect: A system so customizable as to become a poor replica of the software development platform
    Input kludge: Failing to specify and implement the handling of possibly invalid input
    Interface bloat: Making an interface so powerful that it is extremely difficult to implement
    Magic pushbutton: A form with no dynamic validation or input assistance, such as dropdowns
    Race hazard (or race condition): Failing to see the consequences of events that can sometimes interfere with each other.
    Stovepipe system: A barely maintainable assemblage of ill-related components

Object-oriented programming

    Anemic domain model: The use of the domain model without any business logic. The domain model's objects cannot guarantee their correctness at any moment, because their validation and mutation logic is placed somewhere outside (most likely in multiple places). Martin Fowler considers this to be an anti-pattern, but some disagree that it is always an anti-pattern.[8]
    Call super: Requiring subclasses to call a superclass's overridden method
    Circleâ€“ellipse problem: Subtyping variable-types on the basis of value-subtypes
    Circular dependency: Introducing unnecessary direct or indirect mutual dependencies between objects or software modules
    Constant interface: Using interfaces to define constants
    God object: Concentrating too many functions in a single part of the design (class)
    Object cesspool: Reusing objects whose state does not conform to the (possibly implicit) contract for re-use
    Object orgy: Failing to properly encapsulate objects permitting unrestricted access to their internals
    Poltergeists: Objects whose sole purpose is to pass information to another object
    Sequential coupling: A class that requires its methods to be called in a particular order
    Yo-yo problem: A structure (e.g., of inheritance) that is hard to understand due to excessive fragmentation

Programming

    Accidental complexity: Programming tasks that could be eliminated with better tools (as opposed to essential complexity inherent in the problem being solved)
    Action at a distance: Unexpected interaction between widely separated parts of a system
    Boat anchor: Retaining a part of a system that no longer has any use
    Busy waiting: Consuming CPU while waiting for something to happen, usually by repeated checking instead of messaging
    Caching failure: Forgetting to clear a cache that holds a negative result (error) after the error condition has been corrected
    Cargo cult programming: Using patterns and methods without understanding why
    Coding by exception: Adding new code to handle each special case as it is recognized
    Error hiding: Catching an error message before it can be shown to the user and either showing nothing or showing a meaningless message. This anti-pattern is also named Diaper Pattern. Also can refer to erasing the Stack trace during exception handling, which can hamper debugging.
    Hard code: Embedding assumptions about the environment of a system in its implementation
    Lasagna code: Programs whose structure consists of too many layers of inheritance
    Lava flow: Retaining undesirable (redundant or low-quality) code because removing it is too expensive or has unpredictable consequences[9][10]
    Loop-switch sequence: Encoding a set of sequential steps using a switch within a loop statement
    Magic numbers: Including unexplained numbers in algorithms
    Magic strings: Implementing presumably unlikely input scenarios, such as comparisons with very specific strings, to mask functionality.
    Repeating yourself: Writing code that contains repetitive patterns and substrings over again; avoid with once and only once (abstraction principle)
    Shooting the messenger: Throwing exceptions from the scope of a plugin or subscriber in response to legitimate input, especially when this causes the outer scope to fail.
    Shotgun surgery: Developer adds features to an application codebase that span a multiplicity of implementors or implementations in a single change
    Soft code: Storing business logic in configuration files rather than source code[11]
    Spaghetti code: Programs whose structure is barely comprehensible, especially because of misuse of code structures

Methodological

    Copy and paste programming: Copying (and modifying) existing code rather than creating generic solutions
    Golden hammer: Assuming that a favorite solution is universally applicable (See: Silver bullet)
    Invented here: The tendency towards dismissing any innovation or less than trivial solution originating from inside the organization, usually because of lack of confidence in the staff
    Not invented here (NIH) syndrome: The tendency towards reinventing the wheel (failing to adopt an existing, adequate solution)
    Premature optimization: Coding early-on for perceived efficiency, sacrificing good design, maintainability, and sometimes even real-world efficiency
    Programming by permutation (or "programming by accident", or "programming by coincidence"): Trying to approach a solution by successively modifying the code to see if it works
    Reinventing the square wheel: Failing to adopt an existing solution and instead adopting a custom solution that performs much worse than the existing one
    Silver bullet: Assuming that a favorite technical solution can solve a larger process or problem
    Tester-driven development: Software projects in which new requirements are specified in bug reports

Configuration management

    Dependency hell: Problems with versions of required products
    DLL hell: Inadequate management of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), specifically on Microsoft Windows
    Extension conflict: Problems with different extensions to classic Mac OS attempting to patch the same parts of the operating system
    JAR hell: Overutilization of multiple JAR files, usually causing versioning and location problems because of misunderstanding of the Java class loading model
